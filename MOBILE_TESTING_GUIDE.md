# In another terminal
ngrok http 3000

# Use the https URL provided by ngrok
```

### Option 3: Browser DevTools
```bash
# Open localhost:3000
# Press F12 → Click device icon 📱
# Select mobile device for testing
```

## Expected Behavior

### When you click "📱 Take Photo":
1. Device camera app opens
2. You can take a photo
3. Photo appears in preview
4. Image gets compressed automatically
5. Console shows: "📸 Compressed image size: X.XMB"

### When you click "📱 Open Camera":
1. Live camera preview appears
2. Camera controls work (flip, capture, cancel)
3. Photo capture works
4. Image gets compressed
5. Console shows compression info

### When you submit the form:
1. Upload starts immediately
2. Console shows: "📸 Image upload detected, extending timeout to 2 minutes"
3. No timeout errors
4. Success message appears
5. Redirects to Add Unit page

## Troubleshooting

### Camera doesn't open:
- Check HTTPS (required for camera access)
- Verify camera permissions
- Try different browser

### Upload fails:
- Check console for specific error
- Verify image size in console
- Check network connection

### Timeout errors:
- Verify timeout configuration in AxiosInstance.js
- Check if compression is working
- Try smaller images

## Console Messages to Look For

### Good Signs ✅
```
📸 Compressed image size: 1.2MB
📸 Image upload detected, extending timeout to 2 minutes
✅ API Response successful: /api/products
✅ Photo captured successfully
```

### Warning Signs ⚠️
```
⚠️ IMAGE WARNING - Image is large: 8.5MB
⚠️ Used extra compression due to large size
⏰ Request timed out: /api/products
```

## Quick Test Script

1. **Open app on phone**
2. **Go to Add Product page**
3. **Test "📱 Take Photo"** - should open camera
4. **Take a photo** - should compress and preview
5. **Fill product details** - name, category, etc.
6. **Submit form** - should upload without errors
7. **Check console** - should show compression messages

## Performance Expectations

### Image Sizes:
- Original: 4-8MB (typical phone photo)
- Compressed: 1-2MB (after processing)
- Upload time: 5-15 seconds depending on connection

### Timeouts:
- Regular requests: 60 seconds
- Image uploads: 2 minutes
- Should not timeout with compression

The combination of image compression + extended timeouts should eliminate network errors! 🎉
